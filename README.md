Enterprise Centralized Log Monitoring using ELK Stack

This project demonstrates the deployment of an enterprise-grade centralized log monitoring solution using the ELK Stack (Elasticsearch and Kibana) on Ubuntu Server.

The objective of this project is to design, deploy, and configure a lightweight SIEM-ready log monitoring environment capable of detecting security events such as brute-force login attempts, privilege escalation activities, and suspicious system behavior.

The lab simulates a real-world enterprise environment where logs are centrally collected, indexed, and visualized for security monitoring and operational visibility.
